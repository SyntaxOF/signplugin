# signplugin
This is the source code of my SignPlugin!

How to install:

Put this plugin (file) into your server's plugin folder. Restart the server and you are ready to use it! Nothing else is needed expect changing the prefix in the config file.


If you search for a functioning and easy-to-use sign plugin, you found it!

If you know GrieferGames.net or other servers, you know that there is the ability to sign Items. That means by signing them, you give the item a lore which only the owner of can change/remove it.

With this tool you can create very important and valuable items that are signed by the team. These items can be used then to trade around players for other goods.

Commands:
sign
unsign
Permissions:
sign.sign
sign.unsign
sign.sign.colours
And that's already it!
A very easy-to-use tool that brings a very nice variety to your server.

You can also change the Prefix and enable/disable the plugin if you want to.

More languages, more support and more config settings will be added in future!

I'd also be very happy about a feedback to improve my work!
